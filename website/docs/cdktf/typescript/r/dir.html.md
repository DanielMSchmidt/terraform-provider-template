  Renders a directory of templates.

# template_dir

Renders a directory containing templates into a separate directory of
corresponding rendered files.

`templateDir` is similar to [`templateFile`](../d/file.html) but it walks
a given source directory and treats every file it encounters as a template,
rendering it to a corresponding file in the destination directory.

~> **Note** When working with local files, Terraform will detect the resource
as having been deleted each time a configuration is applied on a new machine
where the destination dir is not present and will generate a diff to create
it. This may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations are
routinely applied by many different users or within automation systems.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how one might use this resource to produce a
directory of configuration files to upload to a compute instance, using
Amazon EC2 as a placeholder.

```typescript
// Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformVariable, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Instance } from "./.gen/providers/aws/instance";
import { Dir } from "./.gen/providers/template/dir";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*Terraform Variables are not always the best fit for getting inputs in the context of Terraform CDK.
    You can read more about this at https://cdk.tf/variables*/
    const consulAddr = new TerraformVariable(this, "consul_addr", {});
    const serverAmi = new TerraformVariable(this, "server_ami", {});
    const config = new Dir(this, "config", {
      destinationDir: "${path.cwd}/instance_config",
      sourceDir: "${path.module}/instance_config_templates",
      vars: {
        consul_addr: consulAddr.stringValue,
      },
    });
    new Instance(this, "server", {
      ami: serverAmi.stringValue,
      connection: {},
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      provisioners: [
        {
          type: "file",
          destination: "/etc/myapp",
          source: config.destinationDir,
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `sourceDir` - (Required) Path to the directory where the files to template reside.

* `destinationDir` - (Required) Path to the directory where the templated files will be written.

* `vars` - (Optional) Variables for interpolation within the template. Note
  that variables must all be primitives. Direct references to lists or maps
  will cause a validation error.

Any required parent directories of `destinationDir` will be created
automatically, and any pre-existing file or directory at that location will
be deleted before template rendering begins.

After rendering, this resource remembers the content of both the source and
destination directories in the Terraform state, and will plan to recreate the
output directory if any changes are detected during the plan phase.

Note that it is _not_ safe to use the `file` interpolation function to read
files created by this resource, since that function can be evaluated before the
destination directory has been created or updated. It *is* safe to use the
generated files with resources that directly take filenames as arguments,
as long as the path is constructed using the `destinationDir` attribute
to create a dependency relationship with the `templateDir` resource.

## Template Syntax

The `template` argument is processed as
[Terraform template syntax](/docs/configuration/expressions.html#string-templates).

However, this provider has its own copy of the template engine embedded in it,
separate from Terraform itself, and so which features are available are decided
based on what Terraform version the provider was compiled against, and not
on which Terraform version you are running.

To include values from your configuration in rendered templates, pass them
via the `vars` argument as shown below:

```typescript
// Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Dir } from "./.gen/providers/template/dir";
interface MyConfig {
  destinationDir: any;
  sourceDir: any;
}
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string, config: MyConfig) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Dir(this, "init", {
      vars: {
        attr: foo.privateIp,
        foo: Token.asString(varFoo.value),
      },
      destinationDir: config.destinationDir,
      sourceDir: config.sourceDir,
    });
  }
}

```

## Attributes

This resource exports the following attributes:

* `destinationDir` - The destination directory given in configuration.
  Interpolate this attribute into other resource configurations to create
  a dependency to ensure that the destination directory is populated before
  another resource attempts to read it.
